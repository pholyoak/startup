## Simon-service
I learned about how to use apis to post inspirational quotes. I also learned how Node.js is used to creat out HTTp Service. I learned Curl commands better for when we used it for getscores and submitscores. I learned better how to use the web dev tools to set breakpoints to really see what the code is doing.

## Simon-react
I learned the steps to convert simon to a react application
1 Reorganize Simon
2 Commit: Commit this version in Git as the starting place for the conversion to React. It won't run, but by committing at this point can revert if necessary, instead of starting over. Make sure you keep testing and committing throughout this process.
3 Create template React application. Run npx create-react-app template-react. This creates a new directory named template-react that contains the basic configuration and template React application code.
4 Clean up template code
  Uninstall and NPM packages you won't use (e.g. stats, test)
  Delete the unnecessary create-react-app files (e.g. images)
  Rename js JSX files have jsx extension
  Replace the favicon.ico with the Simon icon
  Update manifest.json to represent Simon
  Clean up the index.html file to have the proper fields for Simon
5 Move template files to Simon
6 Convert to React Bootstrap
7 Populate App.jsx
8 Create view components
9 Create the router
10 Convert to React components
11 Set up to debug
12 Refactor play.jsx into simonGame.jsx, simonButton.jsx, and players.jsx
13 Refactor components to take advantage of React specific functionality and to create sub-components
14 Move webSocket code from play.jsx to gameNotifier.js
