# startup
This is my startup File

this is my 2nd change

my 3rd change again

I learned how to commmis and push changes through vs code and git bash and then how to view them on github. I tried to merge changes and what not but mine said mine were up to date in git back when I did git pull. I really tried to figure that out but wasn't able to see what I might have done wrong. I also don't understand in my files which is my clone and which is my original. Other than that it was a helpful assignment.

This is a test
