# startup
This is my startup File

this is my 2nd change

my 3rd change again

I learned how to commmis and push changes through vs code and git bash and then how to view them on github. I tried to merge changes and what not but mine said mine were up to date in git back when I did git pull. I really tried to figure that out but wasn't able to see what I might have done wrong. I also don't understand in my files which is my clone and which is my original. Other than that it was a helpful assignment.

Simon Javascript learn:
I learned about how to trigger functions using onclick and timeout and how to store data locally and then retreive it in different parts of the webpage

## Simon-service
I learned about how to use apis to post inspirational quotes. I also learned how Node.js is used to creat out HTTp Service. I learned Curl commands better for when we used it for getscores and submitscores. I learned better how to use the web dev tools to set breakpoints to really see what the code is doing.

## Simon-login
I learned way more about cookies. I was unaware before that cookies could be used to track users. So When a user is logged in, the cookie is added. When a user makes a secure request, the cookie is checked. When the user logs out, the cookie is removed. I also learned about endpoints and how they work with the database to store and get credentials and update the authorization cookie. I also learned how the secureApiRouter works by adding middleware function that checks if the authorization cookie is valid before passing the requres to the endpoints
