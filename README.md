# startup
This is my startup File

this is my 2nd change

my 3rd change again

I learned how to commmis and push changes through vs code and git bash and then how to view them on github. I tried to merge changes and what not but mine said mine were up to date in git back when I did git pull. I really tried to figure that out but wasn't able to see what I might have done wrong. I also don't understand in my files which is my clone and which is my original. Other than that it was a helpful assignment.

For my simon CSS assingment I learned that bootstrap is really fast at certain things but if I want to get more specific I need to do my own CSS styling. I also learned better the syntax to do child elements for example I styled paragraphs within div to get white text. Overall it was a great assignment and I took away a lot.
