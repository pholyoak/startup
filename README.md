# startup
This is my startup File

this is my 2nd change

my 3rd change again

I learned how to commmis and push changes through vs code and git bash and then how to view them on github. I tried to merge changes and what not but mine said mine were up to date in git back when I did git pull. I really tried to figure that out but wasn't able to see what I might have done wrong. I also don't understand in my files which is my clone and which is my original. Other than that it was a helpful assignment.

I learned from the simon javascript assignment about how to attach noises to certain actions. I learned better how to use the onclick method to trigger certain function to happen. Also learned how to store things in local storage and then retreive them on other pages of teh website
